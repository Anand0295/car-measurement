## Abstract

This research presents an automated car measurement system utilizing computer vision techniques for real-time dimensional analysis of automotive vehicles. The system employs advanced image processing algorithms including Hough Circle Transform for tire detection and Canny edge detection for vehicle boundary identification. Through calibration using standard tire dimensions, the system achieves precise measurements of vehicle length, width, and tire radius with professional-grade accuracy.

## Introduction

Accurate vehicle dimension measurement is crucial in automotive engineering, insurance assessment, and fleet management. Traditional measurement methods require physical access to vehicles and manual measurement tools, which are time-consuming and prone to human error. This system addresses these limitations by providing a non-contact, automated solution using computer vision technology.

## Methodology

### 2.1 Image Processing Pipeline

The measurement system implements a multi-stage image processing pipeline:

1. **Preprocessing**: Gaussian blur filtering for noise reduction
2. **Feature Detection**: Hough Circle Transform for tire identification
3. **Edge Detection**: Canny algorithm for vehicle boundary extraction
4. **Contour Analysis**: Largest contour identification for vehicle outline
5. **Calibration**: Pixel-to-centimeter conversion using tire diameter reference

### 2.2 Mathematical Model

The system employs the following calibration formula:

```
pixels_per_cm = (tire_radius_pixels × 2) / tire_diameter_cm
```

Where the standard tire diameter is assumed to be 65 cm for calibration purposes.

### 2.3 Measurement Calculations

Vehicle dimensions are calculated using:

```
length_cm = bounding_box_width / pixels_per_cm
width_cm = bounding_box_height / pixels_per_cm
tire_radius_cm = detected_radius_pixels / pixels_per_cm
```
